# Actions

Documentation and examples of the existing actions can be found on the below links:

- [set](../set)
- [print](../print)
- [assert](../assert)
- [http](../http)
- [mongo](../mongo).
- [call](../call).
- [sleep](../sleep).
- [block](../block).

New actions are in progress: `graphql`, `grpc`, `mysql` and `postgres` among others. 

Currently, I'm working on a guide for developers to explain how to create new actions.
